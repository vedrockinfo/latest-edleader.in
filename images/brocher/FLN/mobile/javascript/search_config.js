To make change sustainable and             scalable to every child, we need to transform the             education system as a whole - its pedagogies,             processes, and policies. This transformation is             especially critical in early childhood education,             where foundational skills and lifelong learning             attitudes are cultivated.                 We will examine some key changes the education system urgently           requires, particularly in early childhood education, and share some            inspirational stories of governments, organizations, and individuals           around the world who are transforming education to make a big            difference in the lives of thousands of children and adult learners.","ALfA                 Worldwide                                                                                       Asia                 Philippines                   Maldives                                         Latin America                   Africa                     India                                                Peru                      Kenya                    Nepal               North America                   Guyana                     Ghana                  Malaysia                      USA               Trinidad \& Tobago              Zimbabwe","Largest FLN \& ECCE Fair              Learn from the Changemakers","","Global Ed Innovator            Fellowships \& Awards              Fellowships and Awards are our way of                     FELLOWSHIPS         saying: “Thank you for being a part of the                All GETI Fellows are expected to carry out their         change process so urgently needed in                      ideas for change post selection, and to gather         education.” Fellowships are for                               evidence of their implementation on a         promising ideas for research                                       regular basis in an e-portfolio.         and innovations-in-action.
