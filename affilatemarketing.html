                    <h2 id="Terminology" class="h2">Affiliate Marketing Terminology</h2>
                    <p>There are the following common terms that we generally used in Affiliate Marketing -
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>1. Affiliates</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliates are the persons who promote products and services for a particular website to earn
                        commissions.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Affiliate Program</strong></p>
                    <p>Most of the companies such as <strong>Flipkart, Amazon, Bluehost, Hostgator</strong>, and more
                        run their Affiliate programs to promote products and services. It also offers a commission to
                        those affiliates who target the customers to buy their products.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Affiliate Link</strong></p>
                    <p>An affiliate link is a link which a company offers to its affiliate to promote products and
                        services. It also informs the company that which link is clicked by the customer to reach their
                        product.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4. Affiliate ID</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate ID is quite similar to Affiliate Link. Some companies offer Affiliate ID in place of
                        Affiliate Link. Affiliate IDs are also used to promote products as well as services.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Payment Mode</strong></p>
                    <p>Payment mode is used by the companies to give payments to their affiliates. Most of the companies
                        use Check, Wire Transfer, PayPal, and more to give payment to their affiliates.</p>
                    <p><strong>6. Commission Percentage</strong></p>
                    <p>The commission is the amount that is offered to affiliates based on the sale of products.</p>
                    <h4 class="n">Note: Commission percentage entirely depends upon the company.</h4>
                    <p><strong>7. 2-Tier Affiliate Marketing</strong>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Currently, 2-Tier Affiliate Marketing is one of the best ways to earn money. It works as a
                        <strong>Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM)</strong>. It allows us to recommend others to join Affiliate
                        marketing, and if the person recommended by you join it, then you get a commission form the sale
                        that is made through a recommended link.</p>
                    <p><strong>8. Affiliate Marketplace</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate Marketplace is a company that offers affiliate programs on various different subjects.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="Advantages" class="h2">Advantages of Affiliate Marketing</h2>
                    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/affiliate-marketing/images/advantages-of-affiliate-marketing.png" alt="Affiliate Marketing Tutorial">
                    <p>A list of Advantages of Affiliate Marketing is as follows -</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Cost-effective</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Affiliate Marketing is cost-effective because it can be started at a low cost, quickly, and
                        without any hassle.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Convenient and flexible</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate Marketing is more convenient and flexible because it allows marketers to do their jobs
                        form the home, so they can decide their working hours according to their convenience.</p>
                    <p>Affiliate Marketing is flexible because it offers the following 3 types of rewards -</p>
                    <ul class="points">
                        <li><strong>Pay-per-sale -</strong> It means you have to pay a percentage of the sale price to
                            the affiliate marketer who convinces customers to purchase the product via affiliate
                            marketing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pay-per-click -</strong> It is a commission that is based on the number of users an
                            affiliate marketer directs to the organization's website.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pay-per-lead -</strong> It assigned to affiliate marketers when any visitors fill
                            his/her personal information on our site using the contact form.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>3. Performance-Based Rewards</strong></p>
                    <p>In other jobs, we get a fixed amount of salary in a month, but affiliate marketing is completely
                        based on the performance. If we have excellent marketing, writing, reviewing, and presentation
                        skills then we can earn more money without doing more effort.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4. Increase Traffic</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate Marketing helps us to increase traffic faster by generating more links related to
                        products. Generating more traffic also helps us to improve search engine ranking.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Secondary Source of Income</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate Marketing helps us to do secondary job parallels without interrupting the current job.
                        Affiliate marketers work few hours and gain more income.</p>
                    <p><strong>6. No expertise needed</strong></p>
                    <p>Expert marketers (affiliates) are not required to run the affiliate market. Everyone without a
                        professional degree can learn it easily.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. Low Investment Costs</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>We can start Affiliate Marketing at low investment costs. To work as Affiliate marketers, you
                        need only <strong>electricity, ISP subscription</strong>, and <strong>high-speed internet
                            connection</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>8. No customer support</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate marketers do not face problems related to customer support, bookkeeping, and
                        e-commerce. An affiliate marketer handles these entire problems himself to promote and resell
                        the products.</p>
                    <p><strong>9. Passive Income</strong></p>
                    <p>Passive income is one of the biggest advantages of Affiliate Marketing. It helps affiliate
                        marketers to earn passive income. Passive income means to earn money when you are sleeping.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 id="Disadvantages" class="h2">Disadvantages of Affiliate Marketing</h2>
                    <p>There are the following disadvantages of Affiliate Marketing -
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><strong>1. We Don't Control our Competition</strong></p>
                    <p>As we all know that Affiliate Marketing gain popularity day by day, so our competition also
                        varies based on the industry. Most of the companies offer various offers to attract customers,
                        such as discount offers, first-time shopping offers, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. No Guarantee of Revenue</strong></p>
                    <p>No organization guarantees that the Affiliate Marketer will earn the expected revenue. The
                        biggest challenge for Affiliate Marketers is to put all their efforts to maximize the product's
                        brand. If they are unable to maximize the brand of the product, it is very difficult to estimate
                        how much money they made in the end.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Affiliate Link Hijackers</strong></p>
                    <p>In Affiliate Marketing, there may be a chance that our Affiliate link gets hacked by the hackers.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>4. False Advertisements</strong></p>
                    <p>It is the biggest disadvantage of Affiliate Marketing. Sometimes, Affiliate Marketing associates
                        with spammy marketing campaigns that produce spammy, non-relevant, dummy, and false products to
                        the customers, so always be aware black affiliate marketing strategies and false advertisements
                        otherwise your website can completely destroy the organization's reputation.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Requires self-Discipline</strong></p>
                    <p>Affiliate Marketing is like traditional marketing means there is not any established agenda,
                        routine, and guidance to do work.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 id="Parts" class="h2">Parts of Affiliate Marketing</h2>
                    <p>There are the following parts of Affiliate Marketing -</p>
                    <p><strong>1. The Merchant</strong></p>
                    <p>The merchant is also known as <strong>Maker, retailer, creator, seller</strong>, or
                        <strong>brand</strong>. In Affiliate Marketing, the role of a merchant is to <strong>create or
                            sell products and services</strong>. The merchant may be a single entrepreneur, social media
                        influencer, or a large company.</p>

                    <p>The Affiliates are also known as publishers<strong>, distributors, and advertisers</strong>. It
                        is quite similar to the <strong>merchant</strong>. Affiliate marketers advertise merchant's
                        products and services to earn money from the customers. The money that affiliate marketers earn
                        form the customer is known as "<strong>Commission</strong>."</p>
                    <p><strong>3. The Customer</strong></p>
                    <p>Customers are the most important part of Affiliate Marketing. Customers are the users who use
                        products or services to meet their own requirements. In Affiliate marketing, marketers are
                        always trying to find a smart and efficient way to reach their potential customers and sell
                        their products to them. As we know, without customers, there will be no commissions, and without
                        commissions, Affiliate Marketing has no existence.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. The Network</strong></p>
                    <p>In Affiliate Marketing, networks are used to handle all <strong>tracking, reporting</strong>, and
                        <strong>payment activities</strong> related to the affiliate. Some affiliate networks help us to
                        provide full-service management or a self-service management program. We can also use the
                        affiliate network to promote different types of consumer products, such as toys, tools, and
                        more.
