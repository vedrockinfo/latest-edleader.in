                                    students. Today, CMS is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the
                                    world's largest school by pupils with over 36,000 students on rolls. CMS has also
                                    been awarded the highly prestigious UNESCO Prize for Peace Education 2002 - the only
                                    school in the world to be honoured with this award. CMS also organizes 24
                                    international events as part of its unique educational philosophy and hundreds of
                                    thousands of children from all over the world participate in these events every
                                    year. Consequently, the CMS educational model which believes that "School must be
                                    the Lighthouse of Society" and which upholds that nurturing spiritual awareness in
                                    children must be the central focus of all educational activities, has grown into a
                                    veritable school of thought, impacting schools and educational organisations

                                <p>Educationist Australia, Mahatma Gandhi’s Sevagram Ashram</p>

                                <p>The Asha Mahatma Gandhi Project was started in June 2006 to serve the poorest young children in rural areas of India. The first Casa opened at the Gandhi Ashram with 20 children ages 2.6 to 3 years old. Another 20 students joined the class in 2007, including some with severe disabilities. Grace Musumeci, who founded this program, donates her time to guide the children as well as to train the local women to assist in the classroom.</p>

                                <p>Her hope is to help establish Montessori Casas in rural India, which means providing the basic materials – hopefully for local tradesmen to use as models to make themselves, and to train the local village women to become teachers.</p>

                                <p>As the Ashram is open to the public, some of those who visit from either smaller, more isolated villages in Maharashtra itself, or from other parts of India, request that Grace visit them to help set up a Casa in their village also. In January of 2008 she will go to Bodh Gaya in Bihar, the place where Buddha attained enlightenment, which is one of the most poverty-stricken and violent states in India. A young man who came to the Ashram observed the children and asked for help in setting up a Casa there.</p>

                                <p>Grace sees this as her gift – to be given the opportunity to help the whole village by giving them the best education we know there is to offer. Eventually her hope is that there will be little Montessori Casas dotted all around India.</p>

                                <p>In order to see this vision realized, donations are needed to provide training and materials. Your help would be much appreciated in helping these children who have so many obstacles to their development. When Ghandi was alive he began ‘Nai Talim’ meaning ‘New Education’ which rings so consonantly with Dr. Montessori’s ideas of educational reform.</p>

                                <p>My talk will draw upon the draft report of the GOI-NCPCR committee that was constituted to develop guidelines on corporal punishment and related issues. I start with the theoretical and legal framework of corporal punishment, mental harassment and discrimination in schools – and build on it to argue for a nuanced understanding of the words we use – like discipline, punishment, harassment etc. I will then briefly delve on the legal basis of corporal punishment, in order to capture the context in which laws are made and enforced. What are we so concerned about CP? I will try and go into the different dimensions of this question and conclude my talk with some ways in which teachers, schools administrators and parents can address the issue in a sensitive and child-friendly manner. Needless to say, I will include discussions on the rights and enablement of children and of teachers. I hope to use concrete examples to illustrate my arguments.</p>

                                <p>Children are our future performers. For centuries children were regarded as miniature adults, no awareness of childhood as a separate state (The history of childhood by de Muse 1974). A child is not merely a structure of flesh and bones and not merely mini adults. In fact a child is FORMATIVE stage of human being and full of potential. Learning begins at birth and it continues till the death. Strong evidence from research shows that high quality early education and child care have a positive and a tremendous effects on children’s. Physical skills – body and muscle development; Cognitive skills–memory, attention; Language skills – comprehension, expression; Pre-academic skills – letters, numbers; Social competence – work & play well with peers, work well with adults; Emotional well – being. And that poor quality early education and care have negative effects. Even during the pre-natal development a huge capacities are made for the right kind of nursing and support. So, we need to give maximum emphasis on establishing a comprehensive approach to early childhood care and education and fostering an environment conducive to a child’s learning and self expression. So it is very important to know for the humanity that what is learning and how a child’s development takes place. Learning is a relatively permanent change in behaviour. It is relatively an improvement status in the ability of a skill. Learning is a changed state of one’s feeling about an object or a phenomenon. Learning is neurobiological process and it takes place in the brain. It works through genetically set neuronal networks.</p>

                                <p>There are many theories and approaches to learning and teaching but where teachers develop reflective practice through engaging in action research in their own settings, the resulting pedagogy is effectively established and impacts on learning and standards in school. Kim Insley will explore the value of engaging all teaching professionals in action research methodologies to improve practice and outcomes in the classroom by examining the evidence of case studies from professional development practices at the Institute of Education, University of London, and by sharing her experiences in UK schools.</p>

                                <p>The goals of basic education have expanded from developing students’ competences in the curricular subjects to enhancing their cross-curricular or transversal skills which are needed for all learning later in life. The Centre for Educational Assessment at the University of Helsinki was established in 1996 to develop an instrument for measuring learning to learn as the foundation for lifelong learning. Today, the Centre works in collaboration with schools and municipalities in the fields of educational assessment, research and development.</p>

<p>As the project manager of the Centre I am committed to the further development of methods for assessing educational equity in Finnish schools and for ensuring that assessment results and research can be utilized in developing practices at school-level. I also work as the vice-NPM of Finland in PISA 2015, coordinating the assessment of collaborative problem-solving.</p>

<p>I am particulary interested in the development of learning to learn skills - cognitive compentences and learning-related attitudes - in primary school, and the role of group processes in explaining differences in the development of pupils' learning-related attitudes. I am also interested in the implementation of the new three-tiered support model in Finnish schools - after all the Finnish way of supporting the weakest pupils can be seen as one of the key factors explaining the country's success in international comparisons such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).</p>

                                <p>It isn't often that a third of a movie audience sticks around to discuss its message, but that is the effect of "Race to Nowhere," a look at the downside of childhoods spent on resumebuilding. The New York Times calls Vicki Abeles' film "a must see movie"; The Washington Post describes it as "a growing grass-roots phenomenon." President Obama greeted its stars at the White House.</p>

                                <p>Aaron has been transforming education since way back when he hacked his own high school experience. He has been designing and facilitating novel learning experiences with and for others ever since.</p>

<p>Having started an instructional technology company while earning his Bachelor's degrees at university (B.A. Anthropology; B.S. Geology) and culminating his formal education with a Master's degree in Instructional Science and Technology, he has since followed a path of innovation and transformation through multiple industries and all levels of education.</p>

<p>Restorative and co-creative practices lie at the core of Aaron's work, with a focus on building 'containers' supporting peak performance and innovation. The containers are agnostic, ranging from corporate culture, to classrooms, to conferences-with intentional feedback loops supporting continual evolution and building internal capacity.</p>

<p>Aaron recently 'edsplored' the world with his wife and three children, has lived and worked internationally, and is currently based on the Central Coast of California, from where he also serves on the board of the Institute for Applied Tinkering, and works with the managing team of the Alliance for Self-Directed Education.</p>
